# FCoin
Wallet for Fantastic Contraption's half serious cryptocurrency.

Idea originally by EPICI (because sleep deprived is as good as drunk): what if we used solving levels as a proof of work? Heck, it's not even decentralized because we need to query the game server to verify solves. Good news is since only humans are capable of mining we might as well make the wallet and miner the same application. Maybe integrate the trading and whatnot as well.

Bad APIs + even worse programmer = WTF level crypto abuse.

Documentation specifications blah blah blah it'll come when more details are figured out by the dev team.
